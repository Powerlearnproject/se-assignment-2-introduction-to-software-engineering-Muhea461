Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: This is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintaining of software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This is a structured process that enables a software to be developed in the shortest time possible and save on costs. It also enables software to be of high quality.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile software development involves iterative development development problems are solved as we evolve. Waterfall model involves testing at each stage of development. This solves problems at each stage.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering: Waterfall model is not very ideal due to lack of its iteractive nature. It lacks feedback and not easy to allow collaboration. Agile its easier to solve problems and its ideal for large projects.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: This is an area of sytems engineering that deals with the process of developing and verifying systems requirements. This enables the system to achieve its primary objective and meet customer needs.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering: This is a design approach that divides a system into various modules. Each module handles a specific function. When one module is changed it can affect the whole system. This affects the testing the modules are not accurate when combined together.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
unit testing- the smallest functional unit is tested to validate expected outcome or behaviour.
integration testing- software modules are integrated and tested as a unified group. 
system testing - this ensures every component of the software works wholly and its performance.
acceptance testing- this is testing to ensure the system meets user needs or requirements.
The importance of testing is to be able to find problems as the system is being developed. It also enables the system to be developed in a way where it meets user needs.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems help to keep track of code modifications. Protects code from unintended human errors. 
Types of version control are local version control, centralised version control and distributed version control.  Popular version controls are Git, version control and Svn.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: The software project manager acts as the link between the development team and other stakeholders of the project. 
Key responsibilities. 
1. plan and develop project idea.
2.create and lead team.
3. Monitor project progress and set deadlines.
4. solve problems that may arise.
5. Ensure user or business needs are met in the software. 
challenges faced.
1. Lack of enough resources.
2. lack of accountability.
3. Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines.
4. Inadequate Risk management.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
This is the process of modifying, changing and updating a software system or module to solve errors and improve performance. 
Types of software maintenance. 
1. Corrective maintenance- this aims to correct any remaining errors.
2. Adaptive maintenance- this contains modifying software to match changes in the ever changing environment.
3. Preventive maintenance- we prevent our system from being obsolete. Reenginering an old system.
4. Perfective Maintenance- improving processing efficiency or performance or restricting the software to enhance changeability.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Privacy- user data from users need to be protected.
Accountability- taking responsibility of actions decisions made in the software development.
Security- Conducting regular security audits on the system.
Transparency- providing clear and easily accessible privacy policies.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
